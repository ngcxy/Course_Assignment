GameBoardPanel class
This is the GUI for the program: it contains the display and controls for a game, and the minefield display (grid
of "buttons").  It's the View and Controller in the MVC design pattern, whereas the Model is the VisibleField 
and MineField.
It is decomposed into a few other classes that are inner classes of this one.
 
MineField class
class with locations of mines for a game.
This class is mutable, because we sometimes need to change it once it's created.
mutators: populateMineField, resetEmpty
includes convenience method to tell the number of mines adjacent to a location.

MineSweeper class
main class for a GUI minesweeper game.
Games use a 9 x 9 board with 10 randomly placed mines.

MineSweeperFixed class
main class for a GUI minesweeper game.
Uses a hard-coded mine field for testing purposes.

VisibleField class
This is the data that's being displayed at any one point in the game (i.e., visible field, because it's what the
user can see about the minefield). Client can call getStatus(row, col) for any square.
It actually has data about the whole current state of the game, including  
the underlying mine field (getMineField()).  Other accessors related to game status: numMinesLeft(), isGameOver().
It also has mutators related to actions the player could do (resetGameDisplay(), cycleGuess(), uncover()),
and changes the game state accordingly.
